#
# Skirt around pants to invoke builds from the current directory.
#
# Features:
#
#  - Determines target to build based on current working directory.
#
#  - Default goal to 'compile' of the default target for the current
#    directory.
#
#  - Adds --binary-deployjar option when goal is 'binary'.
#

if [ $# == 0 ]; then goal="compile"; else goal=$1; fi
if [ $# == 2 ]; then target=":${*:$#}"; else target=""; fi

#
# Fix options to sensible defaults.
#
if [ $goal == "binary" ]; then goal="binary --binary-deployjar"; fi
